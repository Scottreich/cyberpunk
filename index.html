      <p> What does it mean to be human? How do we decide which path to take along the journey of our lives? On the streets of Velvet City a homeless android begs for enough bit coin to buy himself some code.  Around the corner a SCorp enforcer takes down a Terminal Tom for peddling illegal code. The city is full of stories.... this is yours.</p>

      <div class="textbox">
        <p>You sit alone at your desk and count the minutes. 7:55am,  five minutes before you need to get on the beat.</p>
        <p>As you start to lean back in your chair and count the ceiling tiles, your trapper keeper chimes a developing news alert. <div class="blockquote"><strong>"Neural Crash causes millions to fall into coma - Is your brain potato safe?"</strong><footer class="blockquote-footer">5 million views</footer></div></p>
        <p>Your stomach flapjacks as the fear slowly starts to creep in and shake you to the core.</p>
        <p>'This is bad, <span class="player-name"></span>,' you say to yourself... This is real bad.</p>
        <p>The neural link, AKA "the brain potato," is arguably the most important innovation of the 21st century. No longer is nature the gatekeeper to untapped potential.</p>
        <p>The brain potato levels the playing field. It allows users to access, store, and recall  any data type instantaneously. Rich, poor, young, old…. everyone has one these days. Most get the implant directly after birth.</p>
        <p>You can’t help but wonder… Will you be safe?</p>
        <p>"Time to begin work <span class="player-name"></span>!" the trapper keeper chimes as the clock read 8am.</p>
        <p>“Same stuff… different day,” you mutter to yourself. The last thing you want to do is spend all day writing full pieces. All you can think about is the event the Journalists are calling “The Crash.”
        You reach for your trapper keeper to get started for the day.. Then you have a thought… maybe you should reach out to some contacts… see if you can learn more about the crash.</p>

        <p>You decide not to poke your nose in places it doesn't belong. Your boss would have been making a bigger deal out of it, like he does with the CyberBall playoffs he had you working on last week. Still, you can’t shake the feeling that there was more to it than what SCorp was playing it off as. Millions of people shouldn’t just shut off like that.</p>
        <p>You decide it would be better if you just forgot about all of it at the bottom of a drink, so after clocking out and putting on your jacket, you get on your hoverbike and head straight for the bar. The bar you frequent, the Grisly Grotto, is a sort of classy joint. Music from long before the Restructuring echoes through the room, giving the place a very nostalgic vibe</p>

      <div class="textbox">
        <p>The Crash is still in your mind; you can’t stop thinking about it. You go to Westwood Park to try to relax, but the old, dying trees and tainted sunlight give you no comfort. People mill by at a listless pace, gas masks over their faces.</p>
        <p>Why did all those people crash? Is it going to happen again, or to <i>you</i>? You feel sick, uneasy, like you have to get to the bottom of this. One of your old chummers from academy might know. You heard he’d got a pretty nice gig with SCorp as an ICE controller. The park is now deserted, and seems sad, haunted. You stomp at a rat that scurries by your feet.</p>
        <p>Ehh, it’s worth a shot. You call up Zephyr Dionikes on your vidphone.</p>
        <p>“<span class="player-name"></span>, what’s going down?”</p>
        <p>“Hey, Zephyr. You know anything about the Crash? I can’t stop thinking about it,” you say.</p>
        <p>Zephyr stays silent for a few minutes. “<span class="player-name"></span>, don’t look too close. <p>That’s my advice. Go to your job tomorrow, try to be happy, find a date this weekend.”</p>
        <p>“Zeph, tell me. I need to know. What happened?”</p>
        <p>He takes a moment to rub his furrowed brow. <span class="kowabunga">ENCRYPTED</span> flashed onto the screen. “Fine, you asked for it. Look into Dot Corp.” The line disconnects... He looked really concerned. It’s been a long day. Whatever Zeph pointed me towards, it’s probably not good. Time to get back home. As you walk, you see someone down and out slumped next to a tree.</p>

        <p>You try and focus on anything EXCEPT for the tip you just learned, but you can’t seem to push it out of you mind. What had him so worked up? Is there something nefarious related to “The Crash”.</p>
        <p>“DING FLOOR 200!” the mag lift announces. </p>
        <p>You step into the desolate hall of your apartment floor and make your way to door 200e2. The room is nearly empty save a bed, a nightstand, and a vintage felix the cat alarm clock. The techno greasy glow of the magenta city scape illuminates cold room. You take a moment and finally decide that you need to know what is being hidden from the public about “The Crash”.</p>
        <p>You set the brain potato to twice stuffed and frame jack into the SCorp repositories. You execute a bit of custom script and find something unusual. An error in the commit log for the latest neural link software update. There are several lines that are redacted. You dig deeper into the problem, only to discover the horrifying truth…</p>
        <p>A bug. A nasty one. And even worse, SCorp knew it was going to happen, and they did nothing to stop it.</p>
        <p>This could be the end of SCorp if anyone finds out…</p>
        <p>"You have a new message, <span class="player-name"></span>," chimes your Trapper Keeper.</p>

        <p>It seems as though you can't escape the wrath of SCorp. You make a mad dash and catch the mag lift at the opposite side of the room. They  as chase you out of the building and through a network of alleys. You try to evade the omnipresence of wires devouring the cityscape. The tangle you up, slowing you down. The SCorp enforcers are hot on your tail.</p>
        <p>As you extricate yourself from the electric brine with your laser blade, and begin to run again a stranger pulls you in from a side door of a store front.</p>
        <p>"Oh no... SCorp has me now" you think.
        <p> You and the journalist flee into the nefarious neon underground, away from harm above, for now...</p>

        a security alarm screams into your ear, “Security channel compromised”.</p>

        <p>MegaCorp works quick. You make a mad dash for the mag lift and hit the button for the basement. The shadowy figure sprints to the lift door as it close inches before his face.</p>

        Where can you go? Who can you trust?

      <p>Something perturbs you. You realize you have seen this journalist before . It seems as if you crossed paths at a local seafood restaurant. He was in a bathroom stall and abruptly left with a viscous terrier under his arm while you were washing your hands.  His lack of hygiene offended you immensely.  But what happened after that was much worse. You witnessed him meticulously licking his fingers while eating lobster. The act flayed all your senses.  So you made the decision to turn him in.</p>

      <p>A few days later you awake at the Watchers pad to the sound of helicopters overhead. This is bad. Really bad. SCorp is on to you. They must have found out it was the Watchers that leaked the info. You check the Watcher newsfeed. <div class="blockquote"><strong>Crash caused by Dot Corp, covered by SCorp</strong><footer class="blockquote-footer">58 million views.</footer></div></p>
      <p>It’s fight or flight time. Live or die. You climb out the window onto the rickety fire escape and shimmy your way down to your ‘85 Wizzer parked on the street below.</p>
      <p>Finally you get it started, and take off at speed. Your heart is pounding; you’ve never felt like this before. Is it the end?</p>
      <p>All of the sudden, two black SUVs pull up and block the intersection. Panic races through your body. You turn the bike around and attempt to go the other way, but 4 other SUVs pull up to block the opposite side of the street. The jig is up. You’re geeked.</p>
      <p>You dismount your bike, take off your helmet, and stare down your oppressors.
      Androids in black suits begin piling out of the vehicles. How do so many fit inside?</p>
      <p>“People deserve to know!” you shout, “We’re awake now!”</p>
      <p>They form a circle surrounding you. There must be 100… They stand alert, silent.</p>
      <p>Was it worth it? This is what humanity needed to expose SCorp, you tell yourself. Millions of brains wiped by a blank master copy in the blink of an eye. For what? The potatoes made life better, but now...</p>
      <p>Whatever happens to you, you feel like the world is entering a strange, new age, and that you and the other Watchers were the ushers to this great transformation.</p>
